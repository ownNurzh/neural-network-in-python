<h2 align="center">Neural Network in Python</h2>
This project was created to test different ideas and approaches in the field of neural networks.
Here, I implemented my first simple neural network from scratch and trained it on the classic Iris Dataset.

In addition to the main model, I also wrote a small custom library — originally tailored for the Iris dataset, but designed to be easily scalable and adaptable to other tasks.

<h3>Feature</h3>

<ul>
<li>A fully from-scratch neural network written in pure Python</li>

<li>Flexible configuration of the architecture and activation functions</li>

<li>Training and testing on the Iris Dataset</li>

<li>Clean and readable code structure for experiments</li>
</ul>
<h3>Goal</h3>
This is an educational and experimental project — I use it to explore new ideas and better understand how neural networks work under the hood.
